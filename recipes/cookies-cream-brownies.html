    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you love Oreo cookies, you'll love these cookies and cream brownies! They are easy to make by topping homemade chocolate brownies with a layer of Oreo cookies and a creamy topping for a deliciously decadent dessert.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup high-quality unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>32 chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo), divided</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip), thawed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking pan.</li>
        <li>Mix sugar, flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking powder together in a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk butter, eggs, and vanilla together in a separate bowl. Add butter mixture to the flour mixture and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/2 of the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth out with a spatula. Add 16 Oreo cookies in an even layer (4 rows of 4 cookies), then spread the remaining 1/2 of the batter on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are brown and center is set, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pan from the oven and set on a wire rack. Let brownies cool completely, at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Crush 12 of the remaining Oreo cookies. Place whipped topping in a bowl and fold in crushed cookies; spread mixture over the top of the brownies. Crush the remaining 4 cookies; sprinkle over the top of the whipped cream mixture.</li>
        <li>Keep refrigerated until you are ready to slice and serve.</li>
